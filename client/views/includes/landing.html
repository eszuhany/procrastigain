	  Procrastigain delivers your own personal trainer for getting things done.  By giving it your task list, it uses its productivity engine to recommend tasks to work on, while measuring and tracking your progress. <br/><br/> 
	  
	  
	  
	  Your procrastigain trainer keeps you in a time controlled environment where you work on tasks in intervals, separated by short break periods for recovery.  When you don't feel like working on a task, it gives you the option to procrastigain (a way of procrastinating productively) by displaying educational and productive web content that is personalized by your tastes and interests. <br/> <br/>
	  
	  The procrastigain content database is derived from our productive links aggregator.  It allows users to submit productive and educational web content, and classify it with tags.  Other users then vote on the post (giving it positive karma), which is used to rank the post and determine its value. </p>
